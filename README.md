### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For fonts

### What I learned

I did not really learn anything new I didn't know before, but this project was fun enough as it reminded me the joy of getting your hands dirty by doing some actual code. I've been using Wordpress for a month and I almost forgot the fun of coding.

### Continued development

I need to do more coding especially CSS and JavaScript because they have the most complex concepts that can be easily forgotten if you haven't coded a while.
